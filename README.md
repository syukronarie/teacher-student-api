## Background

Teachers need a system to perform administrative functions for their students. Teachers and students are identified by their email addresses. This API supports those core functionalities as outlined in the user stories below.

---

## Features

- Input validation via Zod
- Auto-generated Swagger docs
- Rate limiting & security headers
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Clean layered architecture

## User Stories

1.  **Register Students to Teacher**  
    Teachers can register one or more students. Students can be registered to multiple teachers.
2.  **Retrieve Common Students**  
    Get students common to one or more teachers.
3.  **Suspend Student**  
    Suspend a specific student to prevent them from receiving notifications.
4.  **Retrieve Students for Notifications**  
    Retrieve students eligible to receive notifications based on registration and @mentions, excluding suspended students.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** MySQL, accessed via mysql2 (Promise-based API)
- **Validation:** Zod + zod-to-openapi (for Swagger docs)
- **Logging:** Winston with correlation IDs
- **Testing:** Jest (unit tests)
- **Other:** Rate limiting, centralized error handling, modular layers

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- MySQL server running locally or remotely
- npm or yarn package manager

---

## Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syukronarie/teacher-student-api.git cd teacher-student-api
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
cd teacher-student-api
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=teacher_student_db
PORT=3000
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=15
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100
```

4. **Initialize the database**

Setup MySQL database and run the schema SQL script.
Run the SQL scripts or use the migration tool to create the required tables.

5. **Start the server**

```bash
npm start
```

The server will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

ðŸ§­ **API Docs:** Once running, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/api-docs](http://localhost:3000/api-docs) to view Swagger documentation.
